Win-X is a modded version of Windows built from Windows 10 LTSC 2015. The goal is to create a streamlined and minimal operating system while maintaining compatibility with most applications and hardware. This project focuses on reducing the bloat that is typically associated with standard Windows distributions.

Win-X is designed with a stripped-down version of the desktop environment and minimal drivers, removing unnecessary features and services. The system is optimized for speed and performance, ideal for low-end hardware or users who simply want a lightweight version of Windows.

While the project isn't available yet, once it is, Win-X will provide a clean, efficient, and highly customizable version of Windows that can be used in various environments, such as virtual machines, older PCs, or specialized setups.
